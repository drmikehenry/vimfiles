Simple doctest with multiple lines of output.

>>> print('this is a Doctest block')
this is a Doctest block
this is a Doctest block (repeat)

Subsequent prompts ``>>>`` inside a single doctest block should be highlighted.

>>> print('this is a Doctest block')
this is a Doctest block
>>> print('this is a second Doctest block')

Even more text.
