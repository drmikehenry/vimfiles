Roles and interpreted text
--------------------------

Roles such as :emphasis:`this one` but also :youneverheardofme:`custom roles` and :py:class:`domain roles` should be recognised in both :myrole:`pre` and `post`:myrole: post syntax.

Field lists should not be recognised as roles:

The following text is taken from the `reStructuredText Markup Specification`_:

In field lists, care must be taken when using interpreted text with explicit roles in field names: the role must be a suffix to the interpreted text. The following are recognized as field list items:

:`field name`:code:: interpreted text with explicit role as suffix

:a `complex`:code:\  field name: a backslash-escaped space
                                 is necessary

The following are not recognized as field list items:

::code:`not a field name`: paragraph with interpreted text

:code:`not a field name`: paragraph with interpreted text

Edge cases:

:field\:`name`: interpreted text (standard role) requires
                escaping the leading colon in a field name

:field:\`name`: not interpreted text
