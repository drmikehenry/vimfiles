These are a set of plugins for Vim.  You can download released versions here:

  lusty-explorer.vim: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1890
  lusty-juggler.vim:  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2050

  These are certainly well tested, but they can be quite old.  It's probably
  safe for you to use the current HEAD of the dev repository:

    https://github.com/sjbach/lusty

Installation:

- Copy the the plugin/ and autoload/ directories to your ~/.vim.

Advice for submitting a patch:

- autoload/lustyexplorer.vim and autoload/lustyjuggler.vim are generated
  files; modify src/ as well to make sure your changes aren't overwritten.

- "Build" by running `make` in the root of the repo.

- To test your changes for regressions (requires `expect`; may only work in
  Linux):

  $ cd tests/
  $ VIM=/path/to/vim ./run-tests.bash


Note: the Emacs version of this plugin used to be included here, but now it
has its own repository:
