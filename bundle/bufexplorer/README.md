===========

BufExplorer Plugin for Vim

With bufexplorer, you can quickly and easily switch between buffers by using the one of the default public interfaces:

  '<Leader>be' (normal open)  or
  '<Leader>bt' (toggle open / close)  or
  '<Leader>bs' (force horizontal split open)  or
  '<Leader>bv' (force vertical split open)

Once the bufexplorer window is open you can use the normal movement keys (hjkl) to move around and then use <Enter> or <Left-Mouse-Click> to select the buffer you would like to open. If you would like to have the selected buffer opened in a new tab, simply press either <Shift-Enter> or 't'. Please note that when opening a buffer in a tab, that if the buffer is already in another tab, bufexplorer can switch to that tab automatically for you if you would like. More about that in the supplied VIM help.

Bufexplorer also offers various options including:
- Display the list of buffers in various sort orders including:
    - Most Recently Used (MRU) which is the default
    - Buffer number
    - File name
    - File extension
    - Full file path name
- Delete buffer from list

For more about options, sort orders, configuration options, etc. please see the supplied VIM help.

## vim.org
This plugin can also be found at http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=42.

## Installation

If you do not have a preferred installation method, I would recommend installing [vundle.vim](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), and
then simply putting the following in your _vimrc or .vimrc file:

    Bundle 'jlanzarotta/bufexplorer'

If you do not want to use [vundle.vim](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), you can take the zip file from vim.org and unzip it and copy the plugin to your vimfiles\plugin directory and the txt file to your vimfiles\doc directory.  If you do that, make sure you generate the help by executing

`:helptag <your runtime directory>/doc`

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help bufexplorer`.
