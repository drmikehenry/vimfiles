Features
--------

- Two modes: one optimized for daytime, the other optimized for low light conditions
- Made to work with both GUIs (gui) and color terminals (cterm)
- Provides harmonious colors and styles for all predefined UI elements and syntax groups

Usage
-----

To install and use this color scheme, move the file hemisu.vim into your colors directory
(e.g., `~/.vim/colors/`).

The color scheme comes in two flavors, dark and light. To toggle between the two modes,
set the background in Vim:

	set background=dark
	set background=light

To enable syntax highlighting and use the color scheme automatically when you start Vim,
add the following to your .vimrc:

	syntax on
	colorscheme hemisu
