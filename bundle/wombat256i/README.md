### Improved wombat256 colorscheme for Vim

Changes from original wombat256:
* Changed the static background color to terminal default, which makes it transparent (if your terminal is)
* Changed colors of line numbering
* Changed non text to nothing. Keeping space you havn't written on yet the same as the rest, and not hard black.
