******************************************
Fontsize - Adjust font size via keypresses
******************************************

Fontsize provides key mappings for adjusting the font size in Gvim.  The
initial mappings launch a "font size" mode in which single keypresses are used
to adjust the font.  This mode ends after a timeout or when the user presses
any key not defined in the mode.

For example, using the default key bindings, pressing <Leader><Leader>+ will
enter "font size" mode and increase the font size by one.  Once in the mode,
pressing the "+" key repeatedly will increase the font size by one for each
additional press.

See documentation in doc/fontsize for installation and usage instructions.
