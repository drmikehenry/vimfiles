togglecursor
============

This plugin aims to provide the ability to change the cursor when entering Vim's
insert mode on terminals that support it.  Currently, that's limited to iTerm,
Konsole, and xterm is partially supported (creates an underline cursor instead
of line, by default).

Installation
------------

Unzip into ``~/.vim`` (or ``%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles`` on Windows).  You may also
install it under pathogen by extracting it into it's own directory under
``bundle``, such as ``~/.vim/bundle/vim-togglecursor``.

The latest version can be obtained from:
