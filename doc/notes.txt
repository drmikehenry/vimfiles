==============================================================================
1.  Introduction                                        *notes_intro*

These are notes for Vim usage and setup.


==============================================================================
2.  Installation                                        *notes_installation*

Prerequisites for Ubuntu: >
    sudo apt-get install libgpmg1-dev libperl-dev ruby1.8-dev
or, for more automation: >
    sudo apt-get build-dep vim-gnome

Prerequisites for Fedora: >
    sudo yum install -y ruby ruby-devel perl-ExtUtils-Embed python-devel
    sudo yum install -y gtk+-devel gtk2-devel gpm gpm-devel
or, for more automation: >
    sudo yum-builddep -y vim-X11

(Note: this fix is obsolete in modern Vim.)
On 64-bit Linux, Python libraries live in /usr/lib64/pythonx.y,
and Vim's configuration script doesn't find the config directory.
One fix appears to be the following symlink: >

  ln -s /usr/lib64/python2.6/config /usr/lib/python2.6/config

Inspiration taken from:
  http://users.skynet.be/antoine.mechelynck/vim/compunix.htm

The detailed steps for download and building Vim are captured in
the script ~/.vim/buildtool.  See that script for more information.

Update the hg directory (in the default download location) with the latest Vim
source: >

  # From any directory; updates clone in <download>/vim/7.3/hg:
  ~/.vim/buildtool 7.3 update

Unpack, configure, build, and create binary and source tarballs: >

  cd ~/build
  rm -rf vim-7.3
  ~/.vim/buildtool 7.3

Installation of final tarball is done as follows: >
    sudo tar -C / -zxf vim-7.3/vim-7.3.patchlevel.i386.tar.gz

After installation on Linux, the distro-provided global vimrc file will not be
used, so Vim will come up in VI-compatible mode for users (e.g. root) that
don't have a ~/.vimrc file.  To use the distro's global vimrc file, create a
symlink $VIM/vimrc (/usr/local/share/vim/vimrc) that points to the
distro-provided global vimrc.

On Fedora: >
    ln -s /etc/vimrc /usr/local/share/vim/vimrc

On Ubuntu: >
    ln -s /etc/vim/vimrc /usr/local/share/vim/vimrc

To register as the system alternative: >

  for i in gvim gview gvimdiff; do
    update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/$i $i /usr/local/bin/$i 500
  done

If /usr/share/applications/*gvim.desktop exists, it may be necessary to
update this line: >
    Exec=gvim -f %F

to use a full path: >
    Exec=/usr/local/bin/gvim -f %F

Fonts
-----

On Linux, ensure the following fonts are available:

- levien-inconsolata-fonts (Fedora package).  Reference:
  http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html

- Bitstream Vera Sans.  Reference:
  http://www.gnome.org/fonts/

Sources
-------

Vim source lives in a mercurial repository as described here:
  http://www.vim.org/download.php

Clone the repository via: >
  cd ~/build
  hg clone https://vim.googlecode.com/hg/ vim

Windows build notes:
--------------------

These are very green at present.

Follow instructions found here:
http://cream.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cream/misc/

In particular, vim-build.bat is the main build script, and
vim-build-INSTALLS.txt has some pre-requisites.

Acquire and install the following dependencies:

- Cygwin:

  - URL: http://www.cygwin.com/

  - Install to c:\cygwin or ensure that Cygwin's bin directory is in PATH.

  - Install base packages plus:

    - binutils
    - gcc
    - make

- Nullsoft installer:

  - URL: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download

  - Install to default location or customize NSIS variable.

- Python 2.7:

  - URL: Python

  - Use 32-bit standard distribution.

  - Install to default location or customize PYTHON variable.

- Perl 5.8:

  - Prefer 32-bit Strawberry Perl distribution.

  - URL: http://strawberryperl.com/

  - Install to default location or customize PERL variable.

- Lua

  - Use Lua's Windows installer.

  - URL: http://code.google.com/p/luaforwindows/
    http://luaforwindows.googlecode.com/files/LuaForWindows_v5.1.4-46.exe

  - Also requires VC2005 runtime:
    http://luaforwindows.googlecode.com/files/vcredist_x86.exe
    Place this in same directory with LUA installer and it will automatically
    be installed along with Lua.

  - Install to default location or customize LUA variable.

- Mercurial:

  - Use Inno Setup installer (either 32-bit or 64-bit).

  - URL: http://mercurial.selenic.com/

  - Allow installer to update PATH.

ALIGN                                                   *notes_align*
    Align things into columns                           |align|

Align vimball comprises AlignPlugin and AlignMapsPlugin with a combined
version number.

Version 36e_46h from section "Alignment" at

BUFEXPLORER                                             *notes_bufexplorer*
  Buffer switcher and manager                           |bufexplorer|

Version 7.3.5 from http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=42

Installation:
- Follow bundle installation instructions (|bundle_installation|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUFMRU                                                  *notes_bufmru*
  Most-recently-used buffer switcher                    |notes_bufmru|

(Documentation taken from top of bufmru.vim file.)

Usage:
  KEY(S)            ACTION
  <Space>           switch to the most recently used buffer and enter Bufmru
                    mode.

  in BUFMRU MODE:
  f  b              reach more MRU buffers (forward/backward)
  <Enter>           accept current choice
  q                 quit the mode, go back to start buffer (forcibly)

  The mode times out after 'timeoutlen' ms.  A key not mapped in the mode
  (e.g. <Space>) quits the mode and executes as usual.

Note: All unneeded keys are unmapped in Bufmru mode to avoid collisions with
console-mode Vim's Arrow keys (and other sequences that start with <Escape>).
This maximizes buffer switching speed without needing to press the
often-redundant <Enter> to exit Bufmru mode.

Version 3.3 from http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2346

Installation:
- Copy into ~/.vim/plugin/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

:BUN      - unload a buffer, keeping window
:BD       - delete a buffer, keeping window
:BW       - wipe a buffer, keeping window

CTRLP                                                   *notes_ctrlp*
  Fuzzy matches for files, buffers, etc.                |ctrlp|

Local customizations:

- Commands:

    :C [path]  ==> :CtrlP [path]
    :CD [path]  ==> :CtrlPDir [path]

- Normal-mode mappings:

    CTRL-P CTRL-B        CtrlPBookmarkDir
    CTRL-P c             CtrlPChange
    CTRL-P C             CtrlPChangeAll
    CTRL-P CTRL-D        CtrlPDir
    CTRL-P CTRL-F        CtrlP %:h
    CTRL-P CTRL-L        CtrlPLine
    CTRL-P CTRL-M        CtrlPMRU
    CTRL-P m             CtrlPMixed
    CTRL-P CTRL-O        CtrlPBuffer    ; Mnemonic: buffers are "Open" files.
    CTRL-P CTRL-P        CtrlP          ; From current working directory.
    CTRL-P CTRL-Q        CtrlPQuickfix
    CTRL-P CTRL-R        CtrlPRoot      ; From nearest enclosing project root.
    CTRL-P CTRL-T        CtrlPTag
    CTRL-P t             CtrlPBufTag
    CTRL-P T             CtrlPBufTagAll
    CTRL-P CTRL-U        CtrlPUndo

- When CtrlP is active, the pair CTRL-N/CTRL-P moves the cursor vertically to
  make a select, and CTRL-J/CTRL-K move through the command prompt history.

  This is for consistency with other plugins that use CTRL-N/CTRL-P for moving
  around, and to avoid binding a commonly used function to the tmux prefix key
  (CTRL-J).

ENDWISE                                                 *notes_endwise*
  End certain structures automatically

This is a simple plugin that helps to end certain structures automatically. In
Ruby, this means adding end after if, do, def and several other keywords. In
Vimscript, this amounts to appropriately adding endfunction, endif, etc.
There's also Bourne shell, VB (don't ask), C/C++ preprocessor, and Lua
support.

This plugin does remap <CR> in insert mode.  It also adds a <C-X><CR> mapping
to force inserting an end.  However, it the forced version isn't always
correct.

Version 2013-01-01 (fd869a75) from https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise

Installation:
- Follow bundle installation instructions (|bundle_installation|).

  Helpers for UNIX                                      |eunuch.txt|

Vim sugar for the UNIX shell commands that need it the most. Commands include:

  :Unlink     Delete a buffer and the file on disk simultaneously.
  :Remove     Like :Unlink, but doesn't require a neckbeard.
  :Move       Rename a buffer and the file on disk simultaneously.
  :Chmod      Change the permissions of the current file.
  :Find       Run find and load the results into the quickfix list.
  :Locate     Run locate and load the results into the quickfix list.
  :SudoWrite  Write a privileged file with sudo.
  :W          Write every open window. Handy for kicking off tools like guard.

FONTSIZE                                                *notes_fontsize*
  Fontsize - increment/decrement font size              |fontsize.txt|

  <Leader>++    Increment font size
  <Leader>==    Increment font size
  <Leader>--    Decrement font size
  <Leader>00    Reset to default font size

The above mappings initiate a "font size" mode in which the following
additional individual keys become active:

  +          Increment font size
  =          Increment font size
  -          Decrement font size
  0          Revert to default font size
  !          Save current size as new default
  q          Quit "font size" mode
  <SPACE>    Quit "font size" mode
  <CR>       Quit "font size" mode

Other keys pressed will exit "font size" mode and perform their normal
function.

In addition, "font size" mode will automatically timeout after |timeoutlen|
milliseconds have elapsed without a keypress, because "font size" mode is
based on mappings.

Local customizations

- You can Regrep for the word under the cursor or the visual selection
  by pressing <F3>.

Installation:
- Install grep.vim in ~/.vim/plugin
- Install grep.txt in ~/.vim/doc
- :helptags ~/.vim/doc
- Note: grep.txt is not directly downloadable; it was created from a
  copy-and-paste of the plugin web page

- For Version 1.8: the xargs command is using --null.  OS X's version
  of xargs doesn't support this long alias for -0, so replace --null
  with -0 in grep.vim.  In Version 1.9, the new variable Grep_Xargs_Options
  was added to fix this problem.

KEEPCASE                                                *notes_keepcase*
  Search-and-replace keeping case

Usage:

:SubstituteCase/\ctoto\(Titi\)tata/\1Tutu/g  >
    totoTitiTata -> titiTutu
    TotoTitiTata -> TitiTutu
    tototititata -> tititutu
    tototitiTata -> titiTutu
    TototitiTata -> TitiTutu

Can use other delimiters (e.g., #, @, ...)

Use \c to force case-insensitive matching, or use all lowercase in search.

Example: replace MyStruct with YourClass >
    #ifndef MYSTRUCT_H
    #define MYSTRUCT_H

    MyStruct myStruct;

    void
    MyStruct_function(MyStruct *pMyStruct)
    {
    }
    #endif /* MYSTRUCT_H */

Use this command: >
    :%SubstituteCase/mystruct/YourClass/g

Get this output: >
    #ifndef YOURCLASS_H
    #define YOURCLASS_H

    YourClass yourClass;

    void
    YourClass_function(YourClass *pYourClass)
    {
    }
    #endif /* YOURCLASS_H */

Using KeepCase or KeepCaseSameLen defined here, do a substitution like this: >
    %s/\u\<old_word\>/\=KeepCaseSameLen(submatch(0), 'new_word')/g

KeepCase(original_word, new_word)
  returns the new word maintaining case
  simply uses heuristics to work out some different common situations
    given   NewWord
    Word    --> Newword
    WORD    --> NEWWORD
    word    --> newword
    WoRd    --> NewWord
    woRd    --> newWord

KeepCaseSameLen(original_word, new_word)
  Returns the new word maintaining case
    Keeps the case exactly the same letter-for-letter
    It does work if the words aren't the same length, as it truncates or
    just copies the case of the word for the length of the original word.

Installation:
- Install keepcase.vim in ~/.vim/plugin

Version 2012-10-01 (0223dcdf) from https://github.com/groenewege/vim-less

Installation:

LOCALVIMRC                                              *notes_localvimrc*
  Override settings via local files                     |localvimrc.txt|

At startup, searches for and sources .lvimrc files starting from the root
directory down to the current working directory.  Then, for each file that is
opened, searches for and sources .lvimrc files from the root directory down to
the file's containing directory.

The .lvimrc files are sourced by default using |:sandbox| (though this may be
changed via g:localvimrc_sandbox).  At present, Vim restricts the use of
|:setlocal| in a sandbox, so to change buffer-local properties, use |:set|
instead.

For example, to use 8-character tabs in "C" source files, create a .lvimrc
file in a parent directory containing the source files.  The .lvimrc file
might contain: >

  if &filetype == 'c'
      set tabstop=8 noexpandtab
  endif

To re-use a group of settings, create a function (say, in the global vimrc
file), then call it from the .lvimrc files.

Version 2013-01-12 (516ec0f5) from git://github.com/embear/vim-localvimrc.git

LOREMIPSUM                                              *notes_loremipsum*
  Generate dummy text                                   |loremipsum.txt|

The Lorem Ipsum is a famous bit of Latin text used by typesetters for
focusing on layout without being distracted by the text's meaning.

See http://lipsum.com/ for details on Lorem Ipsum itself.

Usage:

:Loremipsum[!] [COUNT]     Insert COUNT words (default 100)

With [!], inserts as a single paragraph.

More options exist - see |loremipsum.txt| for details.

LUSTYEXPLORER                                           *notes_lustyexplorer*
  LustyExplorer - File/buffer switcher w/incr. search

Usage (taken from lusty-explorer.vim):

  <Leader>lf  - Opens the filesystem explorer.
  <Leader>lr  - Opens the filesystem explorer from the
                directory of the current file.
  <Leader>lb  - Opens the buffer explorer.
  <Leader>lg  - Opens the buffer grep, for searching through
                all loaded buffers

You can also use the commands:

  ":LustyFilesystemExplorer [optional-path]"
  ":LustyFilesystemExplorerFromHere"
  ":LustyBufferExplorer"
  ":LustyBufferGrep"

To suppress the default mappings, set this option:

  let g:LustyExplorerDefaultMappings = 0

When launched, a new window appears at bottom presenting a
table of files/dirs or buffers, and in the status bar a
prompt:

  >>

As you type, the table updates for possible matches using a
fuzzy matching algorithm (or regex matching, in the case of
grep).  Special keys include:

  <Enter>  open selected match
  <Tab>    open selected match
  <Esc>    cancel
  <C-c>    cancel
  <C-g>    cancel

  <C-t>    open selected match in a new [t]ab
  <C-o>    open selected match in a new h[o]rizontal split
  <C-v>    open selected match in a new [v]ertical split

  <C-n>    select [n]ext match
  <C-p>    select [p]revious match
  <C-f>    select [f]orward one column
  <C-b>    select [b]ack one column

  <C-u>    clear prompt

Additional shortcuts for the filesystem explorer:

  <C-w>    ascend one directory at prompt
  <C-r>    [r]efresh directory contents
  <C-a>    open [a]ll files in current table
  <C-e>    create new buffer with the given name and path

Filesystem Explorer:

 - Directory contents are memoized.  (<C-r> to refresh.)
 - You can recurse into and out of directories by typing the directory name
   and a slash, e.g. "stuff/" or "../".
 - Variable expansion, e.g. "$D" -> "/long/dir/path/".
 - Tilde (~) expansion, e.g. "~/" -> "/home/steve/".
 - Dotfiles are hidden by default, but are shown if the current search term
   begins with a '.'.  To show these file at all times, set this option:

      let g:LustyExplorerAlwaysShowDotFiles = 1

 You can prevent certain files from appearing in the table with the
 following variable:

   set wildignore=*.o,*.fasl,CVS

 The above will mask all object files, compiled lisp files, and
 files/directories named CVS from appearing in the table.  Note that they
 can still be opened by being named explicitly.

 See :help 'wildignore' for more information.

Buffer Explorer:

 - Buffers are sorted first by fuzzy match and then by most-recently used.
 - The currently active buffer is highlighted.

Buffer Grep:

 - Searches all loaded buffers.
 - Uses Ruby-style regexes instead of Vim style.  This means:

   - \b instead of \< or \> for beginning/end of word.
   - (foo|bar) instead of \(foo\|bar\)
   - {2,5} instead of \{2,5}
   - + instead of \+
   - Generally, fewer backslashes. :-)

 - For now, searches are always case-insensitive.
 - Matches from the previous grep are remembered upon relaunch;  clear with
   <C-u>.

LUSTYJUGGLER                                            *notes_lustyjuggler*
  LustyJuggler - Quick access to recent buffers


Usage (taken from lusty-juggler.vim):

         <Leader>lj  - Opens the buffer juggler.

       You can also use this command:

         ":LustyJuggler"

       To suppress the default mapping, set this option:

         let g:LustyJugglerDefaultMappings = 0

       When launched, the command bar at bottom is replaced with a
       new bar showing the names of currently-opened buffers in
       most-recently-used order.

       The buffers are mapped to these keys:

           1st|2nd|3rd|4th|5th|6th|7th|8th|9th|10th
           ----------------------------------------
           a   s   d   f   g   h   j   k   l   ;
           1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0

       So if you type "f" or "4", the fourth buffer name will be
       highlighted and the bar will shift to center it as necessary
       (and show more of the buffer names on the right).

       If you want to switch to that buffer, press "f" or "4" again
       or press "<ENTER>".  Alternatively, press one of the other
       mapped keys to highlight another buffer.  To open the buffer
       in a new split, press "b" for horizontal or "v" for vertical.

       To display the key with the name of the buffer, add one of
       the following lines to your .vimrc:

         let g:LustyJugglerShowKeys = 'a'   (for alpha characters)
         let g:LustyJugglerShowKeys = 1     (for digits)

       To cancel the juggler, press any of "q", "<ESC>", "<C-c",
       "<BS>", "<Del>", or "<C-h>".

       LustyJuggler can act very much like <A-Tab> window switching.
       To enable this mode, add the following line to your .vimrc:

         let g:LustyJugglerAltTabMode = 1

       Then, given the following mapping:

         noremap <silent> <A-s> :LustyJuggler<CR>

       Pressing "<A-s>" will launch the LustyJuggler with the
       previous buffer highlighted. Typing "<A-s>" again will cycle
       to the next buffer (in most-recently used order), and
       "<ENTER>" will open the highlighted buffer.  For example, the
       sequence "<A-s><Enter>" will open the previous buffer, and
       "<A-s><A-s><Enter>" will open the buffer used just before the
       previous buffer, and so on.

Bonus: This plugin also includes the following command, which will
       immediately switch to your previously used buffer:

         ":LustyJugglePrevious"

       This is similar to the ":b#" command, but accounts for the
       common situation where the previously used buffer (#) has
       been killed and is thus inaccessible.  In that case, it will
       instead switch to the buffer used before that one (and on down
       the line if that buffer has been killed too).

PATHOGEN                                                *notes_pathogen*
  Runtime path management for bundles                   |notes_pathogen|

POWERLINE                                               *notes_powerline*
  The ultimate vim statusline utility                   |Powerline.txt|

The default setup is actually very good.  If you find yourself tweaking the
segments that are available though, make sure to run :PowerlineClearCache,
otherwise you may not see your settings take effect.

Also, the GUI version can make use of a "fancy" patched font.
|Powerline-symbols-fancy| provides some information, but the README in
bundle/vim-powerline/fontpatches/README.rst provides more information.
If you use Droid Sans Mono as your font, a patched version of the font is
available here:
  https://github.com/jszakmeister/etc/blob/master/fonts/DroidSansMonoSlashed-Powerline.ttf

You can also use the following block on Linux and Mac OS X to help detect the
font and use it: >

    " Turn on fancy symbols on the status line
    if has("gui_running")
        if filereadable(expand("~/Library/Fonts/DroidSansMonoSlashed-Powerline.ttf")) ||
           \ filereadable(expand("~/.fonts/DroidSansMonoSlashed-Powerline.ttf"))
            if has("mac") || has("macunix")
                set guifont=Droid\ Sans\ Mono\ Slashed\ for\ Powerline:h14
            else
                set guifont=Droid\ Sans\ Mono\ Slashed\ for\ Powerline\ 14
            endif

            let g:Powerline_symbols = 'fancy'
        endif
    endif
<

If you don't want to use Powerline, you can add the following to your
user/$VIMUSER-before.vim: >

    let g:EnablePowerline = 0

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RAINBOW PARENTHESES                                     *notes_rainbow-parens*
  Highlight nested parens

You can adjust the colors by setting g:rbpt_colorpairs_dark or
g:rbpt_colorpairs_light, based on your background color, e.g.: >
  let g:rbpt_colorpairs_dark = [
      \ ['brown',       'RoyalBlue3'],
      \ ['Darkblue',    'SeaGreen3'],
      \ ['darkgray',    'DarkOrchid3'],
      \ ['darkgreen',   'firebrick3'],
      \ ['darkcyan',    'RoyalBlue3'],
      \ ['darkred',     'SeaGreen3'],
      \ ['darkmagenta', 'DarkOrchid3'],
      \ ['brown',       'firebrick3'],
      \ ['gray',        'RoyalBlue3'],
      \ ['black',       'SeaGreen3'],
      \ ['darkmagenta', 'DarkOrchid3'],
      \ ['Darkblue',    'firebrick3'],
      \ ['darkgreen',   'RoyalBlue3'],
      \ ['darkcyan',    'SeaGreen3'],
      \ ['darkred',     'DarkOrchid3'],
      \ ['red',         'firebrick3'],
      \ ]

When the colorscheme changes, the 'background' option is used to select which
of g:rbpt_colorpairs_dark or g:rbpt_colorpairs_light will be assigned to the
plugin's global g:rbpt_colorpairs variable.  The maximum number of levels
is automatically counted based on g:rbpt_colorpairs and stored in g:rbpt_max.
Finally, g:rbpt_loadcmd_toggle controls the initial state on startup.

Local customizations:

- Turn on rainbow parens when editing Clojure and ClojureScript source code.
- Adjusted the colors to match what was used in VimClojure, and made them
  take advantage of a 256-color terminal, if available.

SCRIPTEASE                                              *notes_scriptease*
  Debugging tools for Vimscripts                        |scriptease|

Usage:

  |:PP|           Pretty print.
  |:PPmsg|        Pretty print the value of {expr} using |:echomsg|.
  |:Runtime|      Reload runtime files.  Like |:runtime!|, but it unlets any
                include guards first.
  |:Disarm|       Remove a runtime file's maps, commands, and autocommands,
                effectively disabling it.
  |:Scriptnames|  Load |:scriptnames| into the quickfix list.
  |:Verbose|      Capture the output of a `:verbose` invocation into the
                preview window.
  |:Time|         Measure how long a command takes.
  |:Breakadd|     Like its lowercase cousin, but makes it much easier to set
                breakpoints inside functions.  Also |:Breakdel|.
  |:Vedit|        Edit a file relative the runtime path. For example,
                ":Vedit plugin/scriptease.vim". Also, |:Vsplit|,
                |:Vtabedit|, etc.
  |K|             Look up the |:help| for the VimL construct under the cursor.
  |zS|            Show the active syntax highlighting groups under the cursor.
  |g!|            Eval a motion or selection as VimL and replace it with the
                result.  This is handy for doing math, even outside of VimL.
                It's so handy, in fact, that it probably deserves its own
                plugin.

SYNTASTIC                                                *notes_syntastic*
 Syntax checking hacks for vim                           |syntastic|

Can launch "checkers" to verify syntax and hunt for errors when working with
particular kinds of files.  For instance, it can run pylint, pyflakes, or pep8
to check the syntax of your Python file and to hunt for other kinds of errors
(unused imports, shadowing of variable names, etc.).

To show a location list with the errors, use the |:Errors| command.  On
actively checked file types, Syntastic will run the checkers whenever you
save.  On passive file types, you can run them manually with
|:SyntasticCheck|.  You can also toggle the mode for a buffer using
|:SyntasticToggleMode|.

Local customizations:
- Turned off active mode for everything but vim, python, and ruby.  You can
  set |g:syntastic_mode_map| if you need different behavior.
- Turned off warnings (via |g:syntastic_quiet_warnings|) because some checkers
  are really verbose (pylint, for example).
- Enabled balloon support so that you can hover over the line with the error
  and see what is wrong.
- Disabled highlighting of the portion of the line containing the error.
  It doesn't work very well, and uses the spell check highlighting by
  default--which is confusing.
- Customized the Powerline segment to use a shortened form for errors and
  warnings.
- Use nicer error and warning symbols where Vim can support it.

An extensible & universal comment vim-plugin that also handles embedded
filetypes.

As operator (the prefix can be customized via |g:tcommentMapLeaderOp1|
and |g:tcommentMapLeaderOp2|):

    gc{motion}          - Toggle comments (for small comments within one line
                          the &filetype_inline style will be used, if
                          defined)
    gc<Count>c{motion}  - Toggle comment text with count argument
                          (see |tcomment#Comment()|)

TEXTOBJ-DIFF                                            *notes_textobj-diff*
  Diff-based text objects                               |textobj-diff.txt|

Support for text objects based on diffs.  You can select hunks, or all hunks
belonging to a file.

Use "df" for files containing hunks, and "dh" for individual hunks.
Currently, there is no difference between the contents of a hunk, and the
entire hunk.  So 'vadh' and 'vidh' both select the entire hunk.

Supports navigating between files and hunks with some movement mappings.  File
mappings move based on diff or index lines.  Hunks look for '@@'.

Version 0.0.2 (822ae0a1) from git://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-diff.git

Local customizations:

- ]], ][, [[, and [] are mapped in diff files to help navigate between hunks
  of the diff.

- The default global mappings have been disabled to conserve mappable keys.

Installation:
- Follow bundle installation instructions (|bundle_installation|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Support for text objects based on functions.  Currently, only C and VimScript
are supported.

Use "f" for text objects based on functions.

    vif   - Select the contents of a function
    vaf   - Select the entire function

To add more language support, see |textobj-function-customizing|.

  Changes terminal cursor shape in insert mode          |togglecursor|

On supported terminals, it will change the cursor when you enter insert mode.
Currently, the supported terminals are iTerm2 (for the Mac), and Konsole.
Xterm is partially supported as well (it will use an underline versus a line
cursor by default).  This technique also works with tmux, although you may

ULTISNIPS                                               *notes_ultisnips*
    Support for inserting snippets of text              |UltiSnips|

Provides TextMate-like snippets for inserting text with placeholders.

Configured as follows:

- <Tab>   - Expand trigger
- <Tab>   - Jump forward trigger
- <s-Tab> - Jump backward trigger

To see snippets whose triggers begin with a given prefix, type the prefix
followed by <C-Tab>.

Snippets live in any "UltiSnips" subdirectory on the 'runtimepath'.  Snippets
earlier in the 'runtimepath' take precedence.  For example:

- ~/.vim/UltiSnips         - Snippets common to all configurations
- ~/.vim/local/UltiSnips   - Optional snippets local to an installation

For select languages, the default snippets provided by UltiSnips are
overridden by local snippets.  This is accomplished by putting the directory
~/.vim/pre-bundle/clearsnippets into the 'runtimepath' before the new locally
defined snippets.  In this directory are snippets files using the
"clearsnippets" directive to wipe out the default snippets.

To avoid rampant duplication when defining snippets, a custom set of Python
scripts is used to define snippets.  For example, the file
~/.vim/UltiSnips/c.snippets.py generates the snippets found in
~/.vim/UltiSnips/c.snippets.  All snippets make be "built" via the Makefile in
~/.vim/UltiSnips by executing "make".

  Provides an enchanced REPL experience for Clojure

This plugin integrates Vim with a running Clojure JVM. It provides a repl that
supports breakpoints, documentation lookup, source code navigation, and
omnicompletion.

You'll need to install the Clojure component. To get this, you just need to
add 2 lines to your ~/.lein/profiles.clj.
>
  ; ensure that redl is loaded on jvm startup
  :injections [(require '[redl core complete])]
  ; ensures that redl is available on the classpath
  :dependencies [[redl "0.1.0"]]
<
A minimal profiles.clj (including REDL, Spyscope, and lein pprint) would look
like: >

  {:user {:dependencies [[spyscope "0.1.2"]
                         [redl "0.1.0"]]
          :injections [(require 'spyscope.core)

VIS                                                     *notes_vis*
  The Visual Block Tool                                 |vis.txt|

Performs an arbitrary Ex command on a visual highlighted block.

Mark visual block (CTRL-V) or visual character (v),
  press ':B ' and enter an Ex command [cmd].

  ex. Use ctrl-v to visually mark the block then use
    :B cmd     (will appear as   :'<,'>B cmd )

  ex. Use v to visually mark the block then use
    :B cmd     (will appear as   :'<,'>B cmd )

Popular uses for this command include: >

  :B s/pattern/output/
  :B left
  :B right

Using // and ?? after a visual selection (the // is only available
if you have g:vis_WantSlashSlash=1 in your <.vimrc> file):
>
  ex. select region via V, v, or ctrl-v
      //pattern
<
You'll actually get a long leader string of commands to restrict
searches to the requested visual block first.  You may then enter
the pattern afterwards.  For example, using "v" to select this
paragraph, you'll see something like: >

  /\%(\%(\%80l\%>12v\)\|\%(\%83l\%<53v\)\|\%(\%>80l\%<83l\)\)\&
<
You may enter whatever pattern you want after the \&, and the
pattern search will be restricted to the requested region.

The "S" command in visual mode:
>
  ex. select region via V, v, or ctrl-v
      :S pattern
<
    The ":S pattern" will appear as ":'<,'>S pattern".  This
    command will move the cursor to the next instance of the
    pattern, restricted to the visually selected block.

  Increment visually selected areas                     |visincr.txt|

Using block visual mode (CTRL-v), visually select a column of numbers,
then use one of the following:

    :I [#]  will use the first line's number as a starting point
      default increment (#) is 1
      will justify left (pad right)
      For more see |visincr-I|

    :II [# [zfill]]
      will use the first line's number as a starting point
      default increment (#) is 1
      default zfill         is a blank (ex. :II 1 0)
      will justify right (pad left)
      For more see |visincr-II|

         ORIG      I        II
         +---+   +----+   +----+
         | 8 |   | 8  |   |  8 |
         | 8 |   | 9  |   |  9 |

         | 8 |   | 11 |   | 11 |
         +---+   +----+   +----+

Also try the "restricted" variants (:RI, :RII) which skip over lines
that don't have numbers.  Can help to renumber paragraphs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Per-user overrides

In order to allow per-user customizations while still sharing the bulk
of the vimfiles configuration, a "vimuser" concept is defined based on
environment variables.

These environment variables may be set outside of Vim using standard
operating-system methods.  In addition, it may be convenient to set them in
the ~/.vimrc (%USERPROFILE%\_vimrc on Windows) file before the "runtime vimrc"
command invokes the main "vimrc" file, since no logout/login is required to
make the settings take effect.  It's safe to put assignments like the
following in ~/.vimrc, as the ~/.vim/setup.py script will not clobber them: >

  let $VIMUSER = "username"

The environment variables are:

VIMFILES
  The directory holding the main "vimrc" file.  Typically this will be one of
  the following:
    ~/.vim                            Unix, OS/X
    %USERPROFILE%\_vimrc              Windows

  On Windows, USERPROFILE is an environment variable that often points to
  "C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME" or "C:\Documents\USERNAME", though the
  location may vary.

VIMUSER
  Name of the user running Vim.  This defaults to the logged-in user, but
  it may be changed to allow one user to activate another user's settings
  (e.g., to allow "root" to share another user's customizations).

VIMUSERFILES
  Directory holding the per-user directory for each user.  If not set, this
  defaults to the first existing directory in this list:

  For Unix and OS/X:

    ~/.vimuser
    ~/.vim/user/$VIMUSER

  For Windows:

    %USERPROFILE%\_vimuser
    %USERPROFILE%\_vimfiles\user\$VIMUSER

  The first directory lives outside of the $VIMFILES area, which makes it easy
  to maintain the user settings completely outside the source-controlled
  $VIMFILES tree.  The second directory is more convenient for users
  maintaining a fork of the $VIMFILES tree.

The directory $VIMUSERFILES specifies a per-user runtime directory.  This
directory will be added to 'runtimepath'.  For example, the Unix user
"someuser"  will have 'runtimepath' agumented with the first-existing
directory in the below list:

  ~/.vimuser
  ~/.vim/user/someuser

VIMRC_BEFORE, VIMRC_AFTER
  These point to "-before.vim" and "-after.vim" scripts.  If these files
  exist, they will be sourced before or after the main "vimrc" file.  The
  "-before.vim" hook is useful for changing things like <Leader> so that it
  will be used by mappings in the main "vimrc".  Most other settings are best
  overridden in the "-after.vim" script.

  By default, these files are named "vimrc-before.vim" and "vimrc-after.vim",
  and are located in the $VIMUSERFILES directory, at these locations:
  
    $VIMUSERFILES/vimrc-before.vim
    $VIMUSERFILES/vimrc-after.vim
  
  For example, the "-before.vim" script for the Unix user "someuser" would be
  at one of the following two locations (depending whether ~/.vimuser exists):

    ~/.vimuser/vimrc-before.vim
    ~/.vim/user/someuser/vimrc-before.vim

  Note: It's preferrable to keep all of the per-user files within
  $VIMUSERFILES; however, for backward compatibility, the following locations
  are also checked for "-before.vim" and "-after.vim" scripts, but only when
  VIMUSERFILES is allowed to default to $VIMFILES/user/$VIMUSER:

    $VIMFILES/user/$VIMUSER-before.vim
    $VIMFILES/user/$VIMUSER-after.vim

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colorschemes

By default, vimfiles chooses a default colorscheme.  To override this,
setup your preferred colorscheme either in a "-before.vim" file or in your
~/.vimrc file (before "runtime vimrc").  For example, in your ~/.vimrc file: >

  colorscheme nuvola
  runtime vimrc

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spell checking

In order to allow per-user overriding of spell-check settings, there are two
variables for configuring spell-checking.  Adjust these variables in per-user
configuration files (e.g., ~/.vim/user/someuser-after.vim).

To disable automatic configuration of the 'spell' setting entirely: >

  let g:Spell = 0

To turn off spell-checking for just "C" source code: >
  let g:SpellMap["c"] = "<off>"

Turn off spell-checking for the entire "<source>" group: >
  let g:SpellMap["<source>"] = "<off>"

Turn on spell-checking for files of type "javascript": >
  let g:SpellMap["javascript"] = "<on>"

Add "perl" filetype to the "<source>" group: >
  let g:SpellMap["perl"] = "<source>"

See g:SpellMap documentation in vimrc for more detail.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Buffer switchers and filesystem navigators

Lusty Juggler - rapidly switch among buffers

  <M-s>  Launch Lusty Juggler; while in juggler, press again to cycle
         through most-recently-used buffers.
  \lj    Launch Lusty Juggler (default mapping, doesn't do MRU cycling).

BufMRU - most-recently-used buffer switcher

  <space> Switch to MRU buffer and enter Bufmru mode.

  See |notes_bufmru| for more details.

Buf Explorer - display all buffers in a list, switch or delete buffers, etc.

  \be    Invoke BufExplorer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building and Running

Press <F9> to save all buffers and execute :make in current directory.

Press <F5> to execute current buffer (useful when editing Python scripts,
for example).

Press <F12> to execute the fifosignal command (a separate program).  Useful
in combination with a separate command prompt using the fifowait command,
commonly used to trigger a build outside of Vim.  For example: >

    while fifowait; do echo "Building"; ./buildall; done

Reference implementations of fifosignal and fifowait are found in
$VIMFILES/tool/fifosignal.  Copy these to a directory in your path and ensure
they are executable, e.g.: >

  cp ~/.vim/tool/fifosignal/* ~/bin
  chmod +x ~/bin/{fifosignal,fifowait}

Note: At present, fifosignal and fifowait are Unix-only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QuickFix window, diff mode

Use <F4> and <S-F4> to navigate forward and backward.  When diff mode is
active, browses through diff hunks; otherwise, when a Location List window is
open, browses through the Location List; otherwise, opens and browses through
the QuickFix list.

Use :DiffOrig to compare unsaved changes against original on-disk.
Use :diffoff to remove diff mode.
Use :diffthis to put current window into diff mode (do on two windows
separately to do a diff between them).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragging text in four directions

Text may be "dragged" in any of the four directions (Up, Down, Left, or
Right).  In normal and insert modes, the current line will be dragged; in
select mode, the selection will be dragged.

Lines dragged vertically move as whole lines.

Lines dragged horizontally are shifted one space to the left or right,
generally as if the standard "<<" or ">>" operator had been invoked with the
shift width ('sw') variable temporarily set to one.  For block-wise
selections, this implies that only the selected block is shifted.

Dragging up:
  <M-Up>        (select mode, insert mode, normal mode)
  <M-K>         (select mode, insert mode, normal mode)
  -             (select mode)

Dragging down:
  <M-Down>      (select mode, insert mode, normal mode)
  <M-J>         (select mode, insert mode, normal mode)
  +             (select mode)

Dragging left:
  <M-Left>      (select mode, insert mode, normal mode)
  <M-H>         (select mode, insert mode, normal mode)
  <Backspace>   (select mode)

Dragging right:
  <M-Left>      (select mode, insert mode, normal mode)
  <M-H>         (select mode, insert mode, normal mode)
  <Space>       (select mode)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deleting "Rubbish" Whitespace

The normal-mode mapping "drw" deletes "rubbish" whitespace, bringing a
run of spaces down to a single space character, or a group of consecutive
blank lines down to a single blank line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deleting Trailing Whitespace

The normal-mode command :StripTrailingWhitespace will remove all trailing
whitepsace from the current buffer.  It accepts a line range as well, such
that selecting a visual range first followed by typing
:StripTrailingWhitespace will strip only the selected lines.

<Leader><Leader>$ is mapped to :StripTrailingWhitespace for convenience.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re-formatting text

The useless key "Q" is mapped to the "gq" reformatting operator.  Pressing
"QQ" on a line reformats that line.  Pressing "Q" in visual mode reformats the
selection.

<M-q> is mapped in normal, visual, and insert modes to reformat the current
"inner paragraph" (as defined by Vim's paragraph operator, |ip|).  When the
'textwidth' option is non-zero (which is typical), the paragraph will be
re-wrapped to that width; otherwise, the paragraph will be joined into a
single long line.

For normal and visual modes, <Leader>q does the same as <M-q>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moving "out" hierarchically

Press <C-O><C-O> in insert or visual modes to exit "out" to the containing
context.  For example, if your cursor is between parentheses, pressing
<C-O><C-O> will move out just beyond the parentheses.  This is helpful for
getting outside text that was automatically inserted (e.g., from a snippet).

The following may be "exited": >

  (Parentheses)
  [Brackets]
  {CurlyBraces}
  break;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional CTRL-O mappings

<C-O>o      - Open a line below this one
<C-O>;      - Append ";" to the current line
<C-O>:      - Append ":" to the current line
<C-O>.      - Append "." to the current line
<C-O><CR>   - Append "." and <CR> to the current line unless overridden by a
              filetype-specific mapping
<C-O><C-H>  - Exit visual modes at start of selected text
<C-O><C-L>  - Exit visual modes at end of selected text

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Movement by screen lines

The standard movement keys have been remapped to move by screen lines instead
of logical lines.  For "short" lines, there is no difference, but for wrapped
lines, this reverses the default behavior of using logical lines.  Use "g" and
the original key to move by logical lines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Emacs-style command-line editing

The standard Emacs-style command-line editing keys as used in Bash have been
mapped for command-line mode.  These include:

<C-A>   Start of line
<C-B>   Move left one character
<C-D>   Delete character under cursor
<C-F>   Move right one character
<C-N>   Next command history line
<C-P>   Previous command history line
<M-b>   Move left one word
<M-f>   Move right one word

<C-G>   Edit command-line history (used to be <C-F>)

The original meanings for these keys may be activated by first pressing <C-O>
(mnemonic: "Original").

Original meanings:
<C-A>   Insert all matching filenames
<C-B>   <Home>
<C-D>   List matching names
<C-F>   Edit command-line history
<C-G>   Nothing
<C-N>   Next match after wildchar, or recall next command-line history
<C-O>   Nothing
<C-P>   Prev. match after wildchar, or recall prev. command-line history

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows-style clipboard support

Because the Windows standard keys for clipboard support are already taken in
Vim, they have been mapped to the same keys using Alt:

<M-a>         Select all
<M-z>         Undo
<M-x>         Cut to clipboard
<M-c>         Copy to clipboard
<M-v>         Paste from clipboard

In addition, old-style mappings exist:

<S-Insert>    Paste from clipboard
<C-S-Insert>  Paste from primary X selection
<C-Insert>    Copy to clipboard

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Putting most-recently-yanked text

By default, yanking (e.g, "yy") copies your text into the unnamed register,
and putting (e.g., "p") puts text from the unnamed register into your
buffer.  Putting text onto a visual selection replaces that selection with
your text, but it also has the sometimes undesirable effect of overwriting
your unnamed register with the previously selected text.  Subsequent "put"
operations will then use the overwritten text instead of your previously
yanked text.

The manual work-around for this problem is to explicitly use register 0 when
putting, via: >

  "0p

To make this easier, a visual mode mapping of capital P performs a put from
register 0.  This allows a yank followed by repeated selections and puts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Search for word under cursor

Vim's standard "*" operator (which searches for the word under the cursor) has
been modified to leave the cursor unmoved.  In visual mode, the selection
becomes the search text.

Use <F3> to begin a :Regrep command on the word under the cursor (or the
selection in Visual mode).  See :help grep.txt for details on the grep plugin
and the :Regrep command.

Use the mapping \z after a search to fold all but the matching lines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pasting lines into Vim

When pasting lines copied from outside Vim, the content is subject to
auto-indentation at each <CR>.  The |'paste'| variable may be set to
prevent these unintended effects during pasting.

Press <S-F12> key to toggle the state of the |'paste'| variable; it may be set
or cleared manually via: >
    :set paste
    :set nopaste
Be sure to exit insert mode when pasting with :set paste active because
mappings are disabled, so <S-INSERT> won't be interpreted as the paste
operation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tag files

Tag files (named "tags") will now be searched starting in the current working
directory and all parent directories toward the root.

The "gf" command ("goto file") will use any filename tags to augment the
search path (:help 'path').

The custom :Ctags command will launch "ctags-std" in the current directory to
update the tags.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cscope

Key bindings have been setup for cscope (:help cscope):

<C-\>c     :cs find c on current word under cursor
<C-\>d     :cs find d on current word under cursor
<C-\>e     :cs find e on current word under cursor
<C-\>f     :cs find f on current word under cursor
<C-\>g     :cs find g on current word under cursor
<C-\>i     :cs find i on current word under cursor
<C-\>s     :cs find s on current word under cursor
<C-\>t     :cs find t on current word under cursor

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Window Layout

Usage:

:L          Layout windows nicely using current number of columns.
:L <n>      Layout windows in an <n>-column format.
:L1         Layout windows in a one-column format.
:L2         Layout windows in a two-column format.
:L3         Layout windows in a three-column format.
:L4         Layout windows in a four-column format.
:L5         Layout windows in a five-column format.

Performs the following:
- Sets number of character columns for the requested number of window
  columns, e.g.:
  - :L1  ==> 80 characters
  - :L2  ==> 161 characters (2 * 80 + 1)
  - :L3  ==> 242 characters (3 * 80 + 2)
  - :L4  ==> 323 characters (4 * 80 + 3)
  - :L5  ==> 404 characters (5 * 80 + 4)
  - :L n ==> n * 80 + (n - 1)

  This leaves room for n windows with (n - 1) dividing lines between them.

- Moves current window to the top (L1 only).
- Moves quickfix window to the bottom and set to standard size (if already open).
- Makes all windows equally sized (via Ctrl-w_=).

*NOTE* If your Gvim window isn't positioned to span the edges of your monitor,
the number of character columns may be truncated to keep Gvim on a single
monitor.  To work around this, move Gvim to straddle the boundary between
monitors before executing the above commands.

<C-Q><C-L>  Toggle the Location window on or off
<C-Q><C-Q>  Toggle the QuickFix window on or off

NOTE See |notes_tips_xon_xoff| if <C-Q> doesn't work in console vim.

The default heights of Location Windows and the QuickFix Window may be
controlled by the following global variables: >

  " Desired height of a Location List window.
  let g:LocListWinHeight = 5

  " Desired height of QuickFix window.
  let g:QuickFixWinHeight = 10

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alternatives to :bufdo, :windo, :tabdo

These behave as their built-in counterparts but restore the current
window, buffer, or tab when they complete.

Usage:

:Windo command
:Bufdo command
:Tabdo command

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlight command

The custom command :Highlight provides highlighting of non-conforming coding
styles to make it easier to locate problems during editing.

Highlights tabs, long lines, etc.: >
    :Highlight *          ; enable all
    :Highlight no*        ; disable all
    :Highlight <Tab>      ; command-line completion to show all options

Options include: >
    commas
    keywordspace
    longlines
    tabs
    trailingspace

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help file toggling

The following mappings toggle the help window on and off:

  <F1>
  <C-Q><C-H>
  <C-Q>h

NOTE See |notes_tips_xon_xoff| if <C-Q> doesn't work in console vim.

If the help window is already open, it will be closed; otherwise, the most
recent help file will be re-opened.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Folding by regular expression

To fold away lines that match a regex, use the custom command :Fold: >
    :Fold regex         ; lines matching regex are hidden
    :Fold               ; use last search pattern (@/) for regex

Use the custom command :Foldsearch to search for lines matching a regex and
fold away everything else: >
    :Foldsearch regex   ; show lines matching regex, and fold away all else
    :Foldsearch         ; use last search pattern (@/) for regex

With :Foldsearch, increasing the 'foldlevel' to 1 will show one line of
context around all matches.

To fold away comments and blank lines, use this custom command: >
    :Foldcomments

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Converting Unicode symbols to ASCII

Use :Toascii to convert a range of lines (defaulting to the entire buffer)
into ASCII.  Mainly this converts several kinds of quotes into ASCII quotes
and generally maps some of the Unicode symbols in the range U+2000 through
U+206F into ASCII equivalents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conflict marker navigation

Inspired by vim-unimpaired, keybindings have been setup for move between
conflict markers:

]n    Go to the beginning of the next conflict marker.
]N    Go to the end of the next conflict marker.
[n    Go to the beginning of the previous conflict marker.
[N    Go to the end of the previous conflict marker.

6.  Tips                                                *notes_tips*

Use the following command: >
    :help quickref
to get a nice quick reference guide.

- Use filetype=Wikipedia for MediaWiki files.

Set 'path' variable to include **/pubinc, **/src: >
    set path+=**/pubinc,**/src

Use |gf| to jump to file under cursor (powerful in combination with setting
the 'path' variable).

Use |:find| instead of |:edit| to use 'path' to locate a file.

Use |]p| and |]P| to perform |p| and |P| with re-indentation of the pasted text.
(Or can use |]p| and |[p| for paste-after and paste-before.)

Try @: to repeat the last ex-mode command; to repeat again, use @@.

Use g& to repeat the last Search-and-replace.

If your syntax highlighting gets out of sync, try the command: >
    :syntax sync fromstart

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command-line window

Special window for editing current and historical command and searches.

From command-line mode or while editing a search pattern, press CTRL-G to open
the window (Note: Vim default is to use CTRL-F, but this has been remapped).

From normal mode, press "q:" or "q/" to open the command-history or
search-history window, respectively.

You can edit, cut, paste, yank, etc., from these history windows.  Press
CTRL-C to exit.

Press <CR> on a line in the window to execute it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debugging Vim problems

- To disable plugins, ~/.vimrc, and ~/.gvimrc, use ``-u NONE``.
- Use -N to set nocompatible.

Standard invocation for bare-vim testing: >

    vim -u NONE -N

Displaying characters under cursor: >
    ga  - decimal, hexadecimal, octal
    g8  - bytes in UTF-8 character

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quitting with non-zero return code

When using Vim as the "fix command" editor in Bash (via the ``fc`` command
or via ``Ctrl-x Ctrl-e`` - "man bash" for details on fc), a successful
return code tells Bash to execute the commands.  This is somewhat
counter-intuitive when mixed with Vim's :qa! syntax which means "throw away
all my changes."  But Vim has a "throw away all my changes and return failure"
command: >
    :cquit
    :cq

This command is the same as :qa! but returns failure so Bash will ignore
the edited command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Redirecting Vim command-line output

To capture the output generated by a Vim Ex command (e.g., |:map|), the
built-in |:redir| command is useful.  For example: >
    :redir @a
    :map
    :redir END
If the output of the command is lengthy, Vim pauses after each screenful of
output.  To avoid this, reset 'more' while redirecting: >
    :set nomore
    :redir @a
    :map
    :redir END
    :set more
Use a capital register name to append to an existing register.  Lowercase
registers will be cleared before output lines are accumulated in them.

A helper command :Redir has been defined to automatically set 'nomore' when
beginning a redirection, and to set 'more' when redirection terminates.  The
"END" keyword is optional to save typing when stopping redirection.
So the above example becomes: >
    :Redir @a
    :map
    :Redir

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using <C-Q> and <C-S> in console Vim                    *notes_tips_xon_xoff*

When using console Vim, <C-Q> and <C-S> are often trapped by the console
(they're the standard ASCII XON and XOFF characters).  To allow them to be
seen by console Vim on Linux, try the following in your ~/.bashrc: >

  # Disable XON/XOFF so CTRL-Q and CTRL-S are available to Vim and friends
  # when stdout is connected to a terminal.
  test -t 0 && stty -ixon -ixoff

This is unnecessary for Gvim.
