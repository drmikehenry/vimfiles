==============================================================================
1. Visual Mode Based Swapping			*visswap*	*v_c-y*	*v_c-x*

	Use any visual mode to select the first text block for the swap
	(V, v, or ctrl-v).  Press <ctrl-y>.

	Use any visual mode to select the second text block for the swap,
	although one generally uses the same mode as was used for the first
	selection.  Press <ctrl-x>.  The text will now be swapped.

	As a warning: mixing visual modes or overlapping the selected
	regions may not have the intended effect.  The selected regions
	do not have to be the same size, however.


==============================================================================
2. Visual-Mode Based Replacement			*visswap-replace* *v_vr*

	This mapping allows one to use a visually selected block of text 
	to replace text at another location.

	Use visual block mode to select the text block (ctrl-v).
	Press <esc>.
	Move the cursor to where the columns are to be replaced.
	Press \vr  (actually, its <leader>vr; see |mapleader|).
