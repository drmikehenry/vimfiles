2. Usage						*runview-usage*

   COMMAND
   	:[range]RunView[!] [filtercommand]

   VISUAL MODE MAPS
	(visual-line-selection) \rh
	(visual-line-selection) \rv

	RunView runs user-selected lines, selected either via a range provided
	to the RunView command or by visual-line selection (|V|), through a
	|filter|.  By default, the filter is ksh; however, the |runview-filtcmd|
	can be set (let g:runview_filtcmd="someotherfilter") in your <.vimrc>
	to override this.  The RunView command lets you specify the filter
	on the command line, too.

	The output is placed in a separate window; it is horizontally or
	vertically separated.  Source code is left unchanged and visible.

	Without the !, the RunView command uses vertically stacked windows.
	With the !, the RunView command uses horizontally separated windows.

	As an example, consider the file: >
		echo "one"
		echo "two"
		echo "three"
<	Using >
		:%RunView ksh
<	the source code window is left on top, but the results of filtering
	the three lines is shown below it: >
		echo "one"
		echo "two"
		echo "three"
		-------------
		RunView ksh Output Window
		=== 01/02/05 06:07:08 ===
		one
		two
		three
<	RunView provides a title and a separator.  Subsequent applications
	of RunView will append a new separator line plus the new filter
	output.

	The package contains: >
		plugin/RunView.vim

3. Options				*runview-option* *runview-options*

                      Option Variable     Default Value
                      -----------------   -------------
   *runview-filtcmd*  g:runview_filtcmd   "ksh"
   *runview-swapwin*  g:runview_swapwin   1

	The g:runview_filtcmd specifies the default application that will
	be used to filter lines.

	If g:runview_swapwin is true, then the source lines and output
	window will be swapped (horizontal: top<>bottom, vertical:left<>right).
