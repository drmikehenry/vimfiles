Significant changes to vimfiles (newest changes first).

Changes marked with "BREAKING CHANGE" indicate an incompatible change that may
require adjustment of per-user settings.

2013-12-10
==========

- Moved fswitch to a bundle and updated to 0.9.5.

2013-12-05
==========

- Add John Szakmeister's markdown2ctags tool to support Markdown files in
  tagbar.

2013-12-01
==========

- Default to Python version 2 syntax highlighting with the newly upgraded
  Python syntax file.  This is done by setting g:python_2_syntax to 1.  It may
  be overridden using b:python_2_syntax on a per-buffer basis, or globally by
  setting g:python_2_syntax from "vimrc_before.vim" or "vimrc_after.vim".

  Also, :Python2Syntax and :Python3Syntax allow switching dynamically between
  the two syntax highlighting schemes.

2013-11-24
==========

- Add :VisualHelp to perform :help on the visual selection.  In visual mode,
  this may be invoked via <F1>, <C-Q>h, or <C-Q><C-H>.

2013-11-23
==========

- Add "Characterize" plugin.  Now typing ``ga`` shows more information about
  the character under the cursor.

- Update the "szakdark" colorscheme:

  - Provide better Error highlighting.
  - Ensure that the background is cleared for pythonDot.
  - Tone down the indent guides so they're less distracting.
  - Make the git commit summary line standout a little more.

- Add :OneWindow command to avoid "Already only one window"
  error messages.  Map <C-W><C-O> and <C-W>o to use it.

- :DiffOrig now closes other windows before starting diff.

- Add :DiffClose to close all diff windows except current window.
  Perform this as first step of :OneWindow.

- Add :Diff command to initiate a diff between current window and
  the "next" window or a file given as an argument.

2013-11-21
==========

- Add support for "##" comments in makefiles.

2013-11-13
==========

- Update vim-eunuch to version 2013-03-02.

- Convert from use of glob(expr, nosuf, list) to older glob(expr, nosuf) for
  compatibility with older Vim.  Apparently the third argument to glob() was
  added in Vim 7.3.465.

2013-11-11
==========

- Convert from Blacklisting of font families that don't support Unicode Symbols
  properly to having a whitelist of known-good font families, since Powerline
  looks very bad when using Powerlines_symbols == "unicode" with a font family
  that doesn't support the symbols.
  The variable g:GoodUnicodeSymbolFontFamilyPatterns may now be set from a
  |VIMRC_BEFORE| script to extend the list of font families that have
  known-good support for Unicode Powerline symbols.  See vimrc for more details.

- Add a way to detect changes in Powerline settings and automatically delete
  stale cached ``Powerline*.cache`` files as Vim starts.

  As a result, these cache files now live below the ``$VIM_CACHE_DIR``
  directory (typically ``~/.cache/vim`` on Unix).  For tidiness, you may
  want to delete any old Powerline cache files in your vimfiles directory.
  For example, on Unix::

    find ~/.vim -name 'Powerline*.cache' -delete

  In addition, if you make adjustments to Powerline settings in your
  per-user |VIMRC_BEFORE|, set ``g:PowerlineRequiredCacheTag`` to a
  unique value every time you make a change to the format.  For example::

    let g:PowerlineRequiredCacheTag = "2013-11-11"

- Cleaned up references to |VIMRC_BEFORE| and |VIMRC_AFTER|.

- Add Powerline segment to detect trailing whitespace.

2013-11-09
==========

- Update Python syntax highlighting support to version 3.3.5.

- Update ColorSamplerPack to version 2012-10-28.

- Unlink the syntax group pythonDot from Normal; this keeps :hardcopy output
  from having a dark background for dot characters in Python.

- Blacklist Consolas from using g:Powerline_symbols == "unicode", as that font
  doesn't properly support the needed Unicode symbols.

- Enable fontdetect and colorsamplerpack bundles early for use in |VIMRC_BEFORE|
  scripts.

- Allow g:DefaultFontFamilies to be set from |VIMRC_BEFORE| scripts.

- Update swapit plugin to version 0.3.2.

- Update BufExplorer plugin to version 7.4.2.

- Update ManPageView plugin to version 25l.  Patch "sleep 2" calls to be
  "sleep 250m" to drop the irritating 2-second delay when K is pressed
  accidentally and no manpage exists under cursor.  Changed
  g:manpageview_winopen back to the default "hsplit"; the value "reuse" is
  painful when pressing "K" for a non-existent manpage, since ManPageView
  will forcibly close the original window after displaying the error.

2013-11-05
==========

- Installed Dr. Chip's HiLinkTrace plugin to display the syntax highlighting
  stack.  Use HLT! to toggle display of the syntax stack.  See :help
  notes_hilinktrace for details.

2013-11-03
==========

- Restored :Highlight functionality.  Highlight groups that are cleared via
  ``:highlight clear`` are not removed, but are changed to have the inactive
  value ``xxx cleared``, causing hlexists() to unhelpfully return true.
  Now a new function, HighlightGroupExists(), works around this behavior.

  See :help notes for details on disabling the :Highlight feature.

2013-10-30
==========

- Added the vim-session and vim-misc plugins.  The vim-session plugin provides
  some nice session management features.  Use ``:SaveSession`` to save a
  session, ``:OpenSession`` to load a saved session, and ``:CloseSession`` to
  close the current session.  See ``:help notes_session`` for more information
  about how vim-session is configured, or ``:help session.txt`` to see
  vim-session's documentation

2013-10-29
==========

- Restore customized settings for the fswitch plugin which were accidentally
  lost when adding the ability to override them with .lvimrc files.
  The fswitch plugin provides the \of ("Other File") functionality (see :help
  notes for details).

2013-10-27
==========

- Perform ``:diffupdate`` on <C-L> as part of screen refreshing.

- Define ``SetupMakeIndent`` to override some indent-related settings for

- Define first-cut experimental snippets for Makefiles.

  Makefiles.  Now 'autoindent' is enabled and the colon key won't force a
  re-indentation.

- Update fugitive plugin to version 2013-10-24 (34e2d253).

2013-10-03
==========

- Upgrade to headerguard 0.2.0; migrate it to bundle-based installation.
  Version 0.2.0 provide buffer-local override capabilities for inserting
  header guards.

- BREAKING CHANGE: Upgrade to fontsize 0.3.0, migrating to bundle-based
  installation.  The default keystrokes have changed to <Leader><Leader>x
  instead of <Leader>xx.  See :help fontsize-customization for configuring
  non-default mappings.

2013-09-15
==========

- Add fontdetect plugin, fixing broken font fallback logic.

2013-09-08
==========

- Add CHANGES.txt to document significant changes.

- Move all interesting documentation into doc/notes.txt, leaving README.txt
  as a pointer into the notes.
